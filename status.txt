Project 2

program works as required
compiles/runs and the output matches the correct format
included comments explaining most lines of code

- testing line "a" against pattern ".." does not work as intended on echo, due to how echo seems to read line "a" with a newline, making the wordcount for line "a" 2
- testing for pattern "\\" does not work as intended on echo, even though code properly handles backslash operators
- code does not support patterns with operators of the same type following one another ("++++", "????", "\\\\")
- code does not support patterns following backslashed operators ("\??", "\++", "\+?", and "\?+")
